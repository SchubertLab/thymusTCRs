# Re-Investigation of Thymic development with advanced T cell Analysis tools
This Repo contains the student project for the lecture "Computational methods for single-cell biology" (Winter Semester 21/22)

Goals:    Application of a joint TCR-scRNA tool, Pseudo-time analysis, TCR target identification, VDJ usage analysis

Data set:    X#todo scRNA and TCR sequenced T cells during human thymus development with donor, age, and cell-type annotation
